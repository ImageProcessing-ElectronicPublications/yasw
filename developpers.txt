Implement your own filter
-------------------------
In order develop your own filter, you have to create a class that inherits from BaseFilter and reimplement at least:

public:
    <Constructor>(QObject * parent = 0);
    QString getIdentifier();
    QString getName();
    QMap<QString, QVariant> getSettings();
    void setSettings(QMap <QString, QVariant> settings);
protected:
    void compute();

This class should provide a Widget that implements the AbstractFilterWidget. The inherited methods (getWidget) from
the BaseFilter don't need to be reimplemented in most cases.

Each Filter should be placed somewhere appropiate under the filter folder. The name of the classes and files should
beginn with the filer name as in getIdentifier().
If you create a new folder, don't forget to modifiy the INCLUDEPATH in yasw.pro.

Have a look at the BaseFilter and the Rotation class (folder filter/rotation) for simple filter example.
