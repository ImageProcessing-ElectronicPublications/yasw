ToDo / Roadmap
 - adapt pdf export
 - separate scaling filter from layout filter -> one may want to sets the settings differently (typicaly layout for all images)
 - checking "preview" on scaling widget does not calculate image
 - optimise YASW: selecting another (big) image lasts 1 second.
   o when loading a project, recalculate is called a lot of times. This should not be!
   o when inserting an image, recalclate ist called twice. This should not be!
 - scaling filter: add padding sizes and/or page size
 - Filter to fix image color / convert to black & white...
   o add filter for color manipulation_/adjustment
   o point to white pixel (or many white pixels)
 - BUG: png images can't export to jpg!
 - png images do not scale well
 - handle empty images (placeholder) differently
 - Load images for Icons in background
 - Implement disable filter
   o disabling a filter (UI) should disable the rendering.
 - progress dialog while exporting / loading
 - Display page preview instead of original image in image list
 - drag and drop in the image list
 - error message on console: kfilemodule(5761)/kio (KDirModel)
   KDirModelPrivate::_k_slotDeleteItems: No node found for item that was just
   removed: KUrl("file:(((...")
 - windows port: security credentials (producer...)
 - add a placeholder at the end of the imagetablewidget, so that can insert an image at the end and
   insert an image on the right when there is no image in the list.
 - Application Icon for YASW
 - autocalibration with a printed grid (line detection)
   o have a look at ppmunwarp http://diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=2589
 - move image from left ro right
 - centralized .h header with includes and default values.
User requests:
 - Add the ability to take a checkerboard pattern as input to the de-warping stage.
 - A way to measure DPI in-situ. Allow the user to draw a line on the pic and inform yasw that the
   actual physical length of this line is x. You could then compute DPI by measuring the length of
   the drawn line in pixels and divide by length input.
   o I assume you would calculate DPI on the cropped image. In that case, use the DPI to also
     calculate and display the physical dimensions of the page or a sub-set of the page as selected
     by a user-defined bounding box.
 - Under rotation filter, allow user to draw a line to indicate what is 'horizontal' - (maybe even
   use 'Shift' key to force a horizontal line, i.e. deltaY = 0) Use the drawn line to calculate a
   finer rotation angle to straighten the page. (maybe name the two filters 'orientation' and 'rotation'
   to distinguish between them).
   -- when I rotate the page, seeing the thumbnail rotated as well.
   -- being able to "arrow down" through the pages quickly, viewing previews.
   -- When I exported to PDF, though, the app exported all the Left images, followed by (most of) the
      "right" images. It should alternate L/R, obviously. Also, I'm getting a white border on the top
      and the left of the images; I don't know if that's intentional or not, but I'd like to be able
      to turn it off.

20130629; YASW 0.5 "release few but release often"
 - Key shortcuts
 - Redesign of the Scaling Filter Widget
 - New policies for propagating changes. I'm not 100% happy as this is quite
   complicated. But I have no other Idea for now... Closes #14
 - Move am image between left and right column. Closes #13
 - Move image selection with arrow keys. Closes #12
 - Segfault when changing settings of a non existent image - Fixes #15
 - QPixmap::scaled: Pixmap is a null pixmap while loading - Fixes #17
 - Fixed #18 Inserted item is selected but does not apear in the filter select
 - Fixed #10 Margins + Positioning

20130601; YASW 0.4
 - Fixed Ticket #2 (Image order not retained when project is reloaded.)
 - Fixed Ticket #1 (Display FileName instead of BaseName in the image list)
 - Fixed Ticket #3 (Propagate settings to all images for one side)
 - Added a background color (configurable) for the filter widgets.
 - Fixed Ticket #11 (Do not interleave pages in PDF Export)
 - Scaling filter
 - Improve PDF Export (a lot!)

20130525; YASW 0.3 "yasw has reached one (1) user!"
 - About dialog

 - key "delete" deletes an image
 - key "pgup/pgdown" to move image
 - windows port (build on linux with mxe.cc)
 - remove add left/right in favor of one "add", wich defaults to left.

20121006; YASW 0.1
 - First release
 - handling two page types (left/right)
