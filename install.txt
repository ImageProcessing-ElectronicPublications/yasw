How to Install YASW
-------------------
Currently, YASW has no install procedure. You can test YASW by compiling it
and running it directly from the compilation directory.

YASW is developped under Debian GNU/Linux, but ought to run on other
Qt-Platforms. If you want to port / compile YASW on other platforms, your help
ist welcome!
