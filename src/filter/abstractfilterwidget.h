/* An abstract class for all Filter Widgets.

  This abstract class describes the members a Filter Widget must have.
  It has to be inherited by all Filter Widgets.

  A Filter Widget must provide a way to
  setPixmap - set the input image (for displaying it)
  setPreview - set the output image (for previewing the result)
  preview - inform if the preview is active
  parameterChanged - inform if parameter have been changed in the widget
