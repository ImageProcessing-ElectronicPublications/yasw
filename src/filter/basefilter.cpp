  \brief The BaseFilter class is the model for all Filter applied on pages.

  It should be inherited by every Filter. The PageFilter class is functional but does nothing, and
  returns the pixmap unmodified.

  Some functions are definied as virtual in order to allow the calling class use a unique interface
  (all Filter can be stored as a "BaseFilter" Class).
